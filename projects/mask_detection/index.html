    <h3>Mask detection with ml5.js</h3>
    <p><b>Step 1:</b> Give permission to your browser to access your camera and click on the canvas. Then, create the dataset by moving your face in different places and angles through the canvas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wear your mask and press 'm' to add examples with mask.</li>
      <li>Remove your mask and press 'n' to add examples without mask.</li>
      <li><b>Note:</b> Try to add as many examples as you can so the neural network has enough data for training. </li>
      <li><b>IMPORTANT:</b> there must be similar numbers of examples for each class, else it will create an unbalanced dataset (normally about 100 for each class is enough, although it is not a fixed number since it depends on the quality of the camera, the brightness of the room ...).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Step 2:</b> Press 't' to train your neural network. The neural network will start training and you can visualize the loss (which must be decreasing).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Note:</b> Depending on the browser, when starting the training, the browser may hang. Please wait patiently. Training may take a while.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Step 3:</b> Once it is trained (50 epochs), click the 'Hide' button.</p>
    <p><b>Step 4:</b> Test your neural network!</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> If it doesn't classify correctly, probabily it needed more examples or the examples taken are not varied enough. You can restart the sketch to create a new neural network.</p>
